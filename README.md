# TrumpSpeak

A text-to-speech (TTS) application where you can generate a voice that sounds like the dumbest idiot to have ever been born.

This is a modified version of ForwardTacotron that has been pre-trained on about 8 hours of Trump audio that has been professionally cleaned and sliced using forced alignment using a tool I created for this specific purpose. I have no intention of releasing the dataset preparation tool due to the extreme potential for abuse.
